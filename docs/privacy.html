      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, display, reproduce, modify,
      and distribute that content as needed to operate and improve the app.

    <p>

    <h3>2.5 Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>
      The BeerMate app, including the app design, logos, UI, and underlying software, is protected by
      intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the app or its content except as
      allowed by these Terms or with our prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h3>2.6 Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h3>
    <p>
      BeerMate may display information about breweries, beers, maps, or external websites. We are not
      responsible for the content, accuracy, or policies of third-party sites or services.
    </p>

    <h3>2.7 Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>
      BeerMate is provided on an “<strong>as-is</strong>” and “<strong>as-available</strong>” basis. We do not
      guarantee that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that all data (e.g., beer info, ABV, styles)
      is always accurate or complete. Information may be sourced from third parties or user submissions.
    </p>

    <h3>2.8 Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p style="font-size:13px;">
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, profits, or reputation arising out of
      your use of BeerMate. Our total liability for any claim relating to BeerMate will not exceed the
      amount you have paid to use the app (if any) in the past 12 months.
    </p>

    <h3>2.9 Termination</h3>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to BeerMate at any time if we believe you have violated
      these Terms, misused the app, or if required by law. You may also stop using the app at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>2.10 Changes to the Terms</h3>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the
      “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, notify you in the app.
      Your continued use of BeerMate after changes are published means you accept the updated Terms.

      <li>
        <strong>Legal authorities</strong> – if required by law, court order, or to protect our rights or the safety of users.
      </li>

    </p>

    <h3>3.7 Security</h3>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access,
      loss, or misuse. However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h3>3.8 Your Rights &amp; Choices</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights over your personal data, such as:

    </p>

    <h3>3.9 Children &amp; Underage Users</h3>
    <p>
      BeerMate is not intended for anyone under the legal drinking age in their region, and we do not knowingly
      collect data from such individuals. If you believe someone under the legal drinking age has created an
      account, please contact us so we can remove their access and data.
    </p>

    <h3>3.10 International Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      Your data may be processed in countries other than your own (for example, where our hosting or service providers
      are located). We take steps to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and
      that your data remains appropriately protected.
    </p>

    <h3>3.11 Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app, legal requirements, or how we handle data.
