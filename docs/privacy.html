        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account details</strong> – such as email address, username, and password (or authentication provider
            details, if we support sign-in with third-party services).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Profile &amp; preferences</strong> – your preferred styles, taste profile, and in-app settings.

          <li>
            <strong>Feedback &amp; support</strong> – messages you send us, bug reports, and other communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional media</strong> – photos of beers, cans, or bottles you upload if that feature is enabled.

        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
        <p>
          When you use BeerMate, certain information is collected automatically to keep the app running smoothly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage data</strong> – screens viewed, features used, simple interaction analytics
            (e.g., how often you rate beers or open the app).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device &amp; technical data</strong> – device type, operating system, app version, language, and
            anonymized identifiers used for diagnostics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Log &amp; diagnostics data</strong> – crash logs, performance data, and error traces, so we can
            identify and fix issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Approximate location</strong> (if permitted) – used for region-aware experiences such as surfacing
            breweries in your country or region. We do not require precise GPS location for basic use.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Data we do not intentionally collect</h3>
        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect or store:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government identification numbers.</li>
          <li>Precise geolocation unless you explicitly grant that permission.</li>
          <li>Payment card numbers (in-app purchases, if any, are handled by Apple/Google).</li>
          <li>Sensitive health or medical records.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          If you believe we have collected data we should not have (for example, because it was
          accidentally included in a screenshot or note), please contact us and we will work with you
          to remove it.

          We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide BeerMate, support the features you use,
          and comply with legal obligations. Factors that influence retention include:

        <p>
          If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize personal data where reasonably possible, subject
          to any legal obligations to retain certain information.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 Security</h3>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized
          access, loss, misuse, or alteration. No system can be perfectly secure, but we design BeerMate with
          security best practices in mind and review our approach periodically.
        </p>

        <h3>7.3 Underage users</h3>
        <p>
          BeerMate is only for users who are at or above the legal drinking age in their country, province, or state.
          We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals who do not meet this requirement.

        <p>
          If you believe someone under the legal drinking age is using BeerMate, please contact us so we can remove
          their access and delete associated data where appropriate.
